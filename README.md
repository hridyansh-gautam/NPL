<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

<p align="center">
    The Digital Calibration Certificate (DCC) represents a significant advancement by providing a detailed digital version of traditional calibration certificates, including essential information such as calibration dates, results, uncertainties, and standards used. The adoption of DCCs enhances data accessibility, reduces paperwork, improves data integrity, and simplifies the sharing and storage of calibration information, thus ensuring measurement traceability and accuracy critical for quality standards and regulatory compliance in various industries. A well-designed user interface (UI) is crucial for the effective implementation of DCCs as it ensures ease of use, efficient data entry, and quick retrieval of calibration information, thereby maximizing the benefits of digital transformation in metrology.
